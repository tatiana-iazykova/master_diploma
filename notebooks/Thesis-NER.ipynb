She was admitted to room 6 of the ward because of uremic symptoms in February 2003. After staying in the hospital for about 1 month, she was stabilized with regular hemodialysis and was discharged on March 26, 2003. During the hospitalization, none of her roommates in room 6 suffered from SARS, but the first SARS patient was admitted to room 8 3 days before patient 1 was discharged from the hospital. Two days after her discharge from the hospital, she was readmitted to room 6 again because of fever, chills, and rigors. On admission, she was advised to put on a surgical mask, although she showed no symptom of upper respiratory tract infection other than fever. Her initial chest radiograph revealed an ill-defined right lower zone air-space opacity, which rapidly worsened after admission.

On hospital day (HD) 5, he developed word finding difficulty and new-onset right foot pain with numbness. A neurologist diagnosed the patient with small-volume infarct within the left middle cerebral artery territory. A lower extremity arterial duplex ultrasound scan was obtained, demonstrating a popliteal embolus. A therapeutic heparin infusion was started, and urgent operative revascularization was planned because of progressive limb ischemia.

Tacrolimus was therefore held starting on postoperative day 1. A kidney biopsy performed on postoperative day 4 confirmed acute TMA and exhibited strong staining for the C5b-9 complex in the glomerular capillary walls, small arteries, and arterioles, without evidence of rejection.
